These are notebooks I completed while taking the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate courses. 
The originals are published under the MIT license, which allows them to be copied and published without restriction so long
as the copyright notice remains intact.

In fact, they [recommend sharing these practice notebooks on GitHub](https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientists-stand-out-by-sharing-your-notebooks), to get a little professional practice.
